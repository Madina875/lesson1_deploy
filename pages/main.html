        <a href="./user.html" class="name-link" target="_blank">User002</a>
        was born under a sky split in two — one half filled with stars and
        constellations, the other a mesh of glowing circuits. Her world was not
        a normal one: mountains had mechanical hearts, forests whispered with
        robotic fireflies, and oceans held serpentine monsters older than the
        moon. Her parents — a scholar of ancient runes and an engineer of war
        machines — named her User002, believing she would be a bridge between
        magic and technology. While other children played with toys, User002
        crafted her own: a small fox made of brass and enchanted gears. It could
        leap over rivers and store memories like a diary. She called it Kyra,
        her first friend in a land where friends were scarce. At twelve, every
        child had to face the First Hunt — a rite of passage against the roaming
        beasts of the steel plains. User002’s opponent was a creature of
        nightmare: part wolf, part machine, with claws like molten glass. She
        didn’t kill it. Instead, she hacked its control chip and freed it from
        the Hunters’ program. It bowed to her before running into the wild. From
        that day, people whispered: "She tames monsters instead of destroying
        them."
